# Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering - Adult Dataset

This repository is focused on performing EDA, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and feature selection on the adult_with_headers.csv dataset.  
The assignment demonstrates practical applications of scaling, encoding, feature transformations, and selection techniques that are essential for machine learning.

---

## Objective
To gain hands-on experience in data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques, including scaling, encoding, outlier detection, and feature selection.  
This assignment strengthens understanding of how to prepare datasets effectively for machine learning models.
